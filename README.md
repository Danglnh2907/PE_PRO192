# SOLUTION FOR JAVA PRACTICAL EXAM (PE PRO192) IN SPRING 2024

This is my solution for PE PRO192 in SP24. You can clone this project, and report any error if you found

**1. How to use this code**

- This is assuming you already have git. If not, [install here]https://git-scm.com/downloads 

        ```bash
            cd <Your_Working_Directory>
            git clone https://github.com/Danglnh2907/PE_PRO192.git
        ```

- If you want to compile this code by yourself using terminal (ensure you have javac)
    
        ```bash
            cd PE_PRO192/Q1/src
            javac -d ../build/classes q1/*.java
            cd ../build/classes
            java q1/.Q1 ../../input.txt ../../input.txt 
        ```
